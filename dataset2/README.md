# Additional dataset info

## 2D labels

We provide manualy labeled pixel coordinates of the center of the drone. These coordinates were labeled for each frame where the drone was distinguishable from the background.

They are in the folder ``` detections ``` and row of each file is in the following format:

``` frame_id x y```
